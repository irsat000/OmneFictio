        <h2>Odin the Omnipotent</h2>
        <h4>Chapter 3</h4>

    <div class="c-body">
        <p>Odin did not even begin to imagine the possibility that he would be forced on their terms. After his
            departure they immediately sent in the final of the reinforcements and began the mission. One of the other
            recruits was dispatched by his uncle, a priest. He had to be taken to Dharod and his group were later sent
            in on the mission himself. Dharod had no shortage of problems.</p>
        <p>A few days of searching at night, a few men,
            a few villagers, and a few men of his group had to go into the wilderness, and on their way, in the evening,
            to try and save a young man from drowning which he had left for another man, when he was shot dead, by a
            sniper as he had been shot for crossing a bridge in the village without a permit, and the other man was
            taken to hospital. The boy did not survive. He tried to run from the crowd, to find a place to hide, but his
            legs ran and he fell flat on his haunches. When he found his way to the hospital, his father took him up to
            the top of a mountain. At his insistence, Tawas and Al-Sarabi drove him to a cabin. In his room, in the bed,
            were the contents of a pistol and a gun. The soldiers killed his uncle. There was no way for him to escape
            but with his father's help, and his mother's mercy, he left the area.</p>
